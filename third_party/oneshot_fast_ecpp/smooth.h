/*
    Batched n^4-smoothness testing for one-shot ECPP (component b).

    For a fixed target prime p we must decide, for many candidate curve orders
    N = p+1 -/+ t (each ~ the size of p), whether N has a y-smooth divisor m with
    L < m < L*r (r = least prime of m), where y = n^4, n = bitlength(p), and
    L = isqrt(p)+1+isqrt(4*isqrt(p)) = (p^{1/4}+1)^2.  A valid m exists iff the
    y-smooth PART of N exceeds L, so the core primitive is: given a batch of N_i,
    compute their y-smooth parts.

    Method (Bernstein, "How to find smooth parts of integers"): with the single
    big integer P = prod_{prime q <= y} q, a remainder tree yields r_i = P mod N_i
    for the whole batch by reducing P once at the tree root and descending.  Then
    the y-smooth part of N_i is gcd(N_i, r_i^(2^s) mod N_i) with 2^s >= bitlen(N_i)
    (deterministic and exact: for a prime q | N_i, q | r_i iff q | P iff q <= y).

    Building/storing P is the only step that scales with y (|P| ~ 1.44*y bits), so
    P is built once per y and cached to disk; the per-batch cost is one big
    reduction P mod (prod N_i) plus cheap descent, amortized over the whole batch.
